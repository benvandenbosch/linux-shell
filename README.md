# linux-shell
Shell Implementation for Linux

Generates a command prompt and allows user to enter and execute commands as they would a normal linux shell. Parses commands (space-separated commands and arguments) and forks/executes them.

Supports up to ten commands separated by pipes ('|') as well as input/output redirection operations '<', '>', and '>>'. \
